To enable [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language support in your IDE, you can integrate [Julia Language Server](https://github.com/julia-vscode/LanguageServer.jl) by following these steps:

## Install the language server

1. [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/). After that open a terminal and type `julia`:
   ![Julia command](../images/user-defined-ls/julia/julia_command.png)

2. switch to Juliaâ€™s REPL by typing `]` to install the DAP server with the command `add LanguageServer`

You could also configure server (you should have completion which will help you to configure server):

## Debugging

If you need to Run/Debug Julia program, you can [configure the Julia DAP server](../dap/user-defined-dap/julia.md).
