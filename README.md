## Description
<!-- Plugin description -->

LSP4IJ is a free and open-source 

 * [Language Server protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) client compatible with all flavours of IntelliJ.
 * [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) support with [Debug Adapter Protocol Run/Debug configuration](./docs/dap/UserGuide.md).

It allows you to integrate any `language server` that communicates with its client via `stdio`:

* by `developing an IntelliJ plugin` with LSP `extension points`:
  * [com.redhat.devtools.lsp4ij.server](./docs/DeveloperGuide.md#extension-point-declaration) extension point to define a language server.
  * [com.redhat.devtools.lsp4ij.languageMapping](./docs/DeveloperGuide.md#declare-file-mappings) to associate an IntelliJ language with a language server definition.
* by manually adding [language server definitions](./docs/UserDefinedLanguageServer.md), 
supporting custom server settings. This approach doesn't require developing a specific IntelliJ plugin.

LSP4IJ also provides:

* an [LSP Consoles view](./docs/UserGuide.md#lsp-console) to tracks LSP requests, responses and notifications in a console:

![LSP console](./docs/images/LSPConsole.png)

If you select the language server node, you can configure it the same way as in the [Language Servers preferences page](./docs/UserGuide.md#language-servers-preferences)

![LSP language server detail](./docs/images/LSPLanguageServerDetail.png)

and use the left toolbar to `Apply` or `Reset` the settings.

* a [Language Servers preferences page](./docs/UserGuide.md#language-servers-preferences) to configure the LSP trace level, the debug port to use to debug language server:

![Language Server preferences](./docs/images/LanguageServerPreferences.png)

You can find more documentation in:

 * [the developer guide](./docs/DeveloperGuide.md), providing step-by-step instructions on how to integrate a language server in LSP4J in an external IntelliJ plugin.
 * [the User-defined language server documentation](./docs/UserDefinedLanguageServer.md), explaining how to integrate a language server in LSP4J with few settings. 
 * [the user guide](./docs/UserGuide.md), which explains how to use LSP console and Language Server preferences.
 * [the LSP Support overview](./docs/LSPSupport.md), describing which LSP features are implemented, and how.

Data and Telemetry
==================
If the [Red Hat Telemetry](https://github.com/redhat-developer/intellij-redhat-telemetry) plugin is installed, the LSP4IJ plugin will collect anonymous [usage data](USAGE_DATA.md) and send it to Red Hat servers to help improve our products and services. Read our [privacy statement](https://developers.redhat.com/article/tool-data-collection) to learn more. This extension respects the Red Hat Telemetry setting which you can learn more about at [https://github.com/redhat-developer/intellij-redhat-telemetry#telemetry-reporting](https://github.com/redhat-developer/intellij-redhat-telemetry#telemetry-reporting)

## Feedback

File a bug in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/redhat-developer/lsp4ij/issues).

You can have 2 kinds of errors:

 * an error from LSP4IJ, in this case, the error will be reported in the standard IntelliJ log.
 * an error coming from the language server.

For the second case, you can customize the error reporting with the `Debug / Error reporting` combo box 
by opening the `Languages & Frameworks / Language Servers` preferences:

![Error reporting combo box](./docs/images/troubleshooting/LanguageServerErrorReportingSetting.png)

You can select:
 * `None` : in this case the language server error will be ignored.
 * `In notification` (default value) : in this case the language server error appear as a `notification`:
![Error in notification](./docs/images/troubleshooting/LanguageServerErrorInNotification.png)
 The error notification shows 3 possible actions:
   * `Disable error reporting` : sets the error reporting to `None`.
   * `Report error in Log` : sets the error reporting to `In log`. 
   * `Open LSP4IJ documentation` : opens this documentation. 
 * `In log` : in this case the language server error will be logged in the standard `IntelliJ log`:
![Error in log](./docs/images/troubleshooting/LanguageServerErrorInLog.png)

You can see this error's details in the [LSP Consoles view](./docs/UserGuide.md#lsp-console) (by setting the `Debug / Trace` combo box in `verbose`):
